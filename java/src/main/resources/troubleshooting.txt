1. checked JDK configuration:
    Go to File -> Project Structure -> SDKs
    your JDK home path should be something like this: /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachine/jdk.1.7.0_79.jdk/Contents/Home
    Hit Apply and then OK

2. checked source path in Library's section
    Go to File -> Project Structure -> Libraries
    Hit the + button
    Add the path to your src folder
    Hit Apply and then OK
    This should fix the problem
